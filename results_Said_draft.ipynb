    "  - **Surprising Rating Effect Shift:** Controlling for votes, the rating coefficient turns slightly negative (-0.0550) compared to its positive effect (0.1663) in the single predictor model. This indicates that higher ratings don‚Äôt necessarily increase revenue once popularity (votes) is considered. (Said's Note: This is a surprising result that may effect our other analysis in this section as well)\n",

    "- The regression analysis provides a quantitative measure of the relationship between IMDb ratings and box office revenue.\n",
    "- The visualization, including the regression line and hexbin plot, helps in understanding the distribution of data points and the fit of the regression model. \n",
    "- The color bar provides additional context by showing the frequency of data points in different regions of the plot.\n",
    "- The slope of the regression line shows the rate at which box office revenue changes with respect to IMDb ratings. And since the slope is not significant, we can say that the relationship is weak.\n",
    "- The p-value indicates the statistical significance of the relationship, with a low p-value suggesting that the observed relationship is unlikely to be due to chance. \n",
