## Abstract
&#x1F3AC; **C1n3mada presents: Money, Money, Movies â€“ The secrets of moviesâ€™ box office success** :movie_camera:

Itâ€™s time to take a break from whatever youâ€™re doing and enjoy some movies. The lineup includes 5 movies, each telling its own story. Together, they provide insights into what influences a movie's box office revenue. 
How do factors like rating, language, country, genre, director or even the release season affect a movieâ€™s financial success? Through the selected films you will get detailed insights in a fun and engaging way. Each factor is analysed individually, with overlapping analyses across several factors, all together providing a comprehensive understanding by the end. In addition to learning about the influencing factors you will also discover possible reasons, as the movies also include explanatory elements.

You will be enjoying and learning at the same time. C1n3mada hopes that you are ready for this unique experience! :popcorn:
