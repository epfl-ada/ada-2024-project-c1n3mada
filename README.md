## Abstract
&#x1F3AC; **C1n3mada presents: Money, Money, Movies â€“ The secrets of moviesâ€™ box office success** :movie_camera:

Itâ€™s time to take a break from whatever youâ€™re doing and enjoy some movies. The lineup includes 5 movies, each telling its own story. Together, they provide insights into what influences a movie's box office revenue. 
How do factors like rating, language, country, genre, director or even the release season affect a movieâ€™s financial success? Through the selected films you will get detailed insights in a fun and engaging way. Each factor is analysed individually, with overlapping analyses across several factors, all together providing a comprehensive understanding by the end. In addition to learning about the influencing factors you will also discover possible reasons, as the movies also include explanatory elements.

You will be enjoying and learning at the same time. C1n3mada hopes that you are ready for this unique experience! :popcorn:

## Research questions
**Movie 1: Echo** ðŸ“¢ <br> 
How does a movieâ€™s IMDb rating relate to its box office revenue? <br> 
This film explores the IMDb rating, being a reflection of audience and critic reception for movies. The correlation between rating and the box office revenue is presented, first for all movies in general and then broken down by genre.

**Movie 2: Tongues** ðŸ—£ <br> 
How do the language and country of a movie influence its box office revenue? <br>
This film explores the importance of a movie's primary language and release country, as well as the correlation between these two aspects. Additionally, it shows whether movies with more than one original language achieve more success. 

**Movie 3: Shades** ðŸŽ­ <br> 
How does a movie's genre impact its box office revenue? <br>
This film aims to provide an understanding of whether certain genres are associated with higher revenues and if the relationship between genre and revenue changes over time.

**Movie 4: Starlight** ðŸ’« <br> 
To what extent is a movie's box office revenue influenced by its director? <br>
This film highlights which directors produce the most movies, which ones generate the highest total revenue and which ones achieve the best average revenue per movie.

**Movie 5: Waves** ðŸŒŠ <br> 
How much is a movieâ€™s box office revenue influenced by its release timing and duration? <br>
This film provides insights into the influence of a movieâ€™s release season on its success. It also examines the impact of the movieâ€™s runtime for each season individually and breaks down these factors by genre. 	

**Movie 6: Treasure** ðŸ’° <br> 
How does a movieâ€™s budget relate to its box office revenue? <br>
This film delves into the relationship between a movie's budget and its box office revenue. It examines the Return on investment (ROI) and analyses how this relationship varies across different genres. 	


## Proposed additional datasets
**IMDb** <br> 
The [IMDb dataset](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/) is a comprehensive collection of information related to movies, TV shows, and other media. It contains the IMDb user ratings for titles, offering insight into audience reception. This dataset was merged with the original CMU dataset. No new movies were added. Only those present in the CMU dataset were included. If IMDb contained a corresponding rating for a movie, it was added to the dataset. 

**TMDB** <br> 
The [TMDB dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) provides detailed information on movies and TV shows. Since it also contains the box office revenue, it was merged with the original CMU dataset to fill in some missing value in the latter. No new movies were added. 

**Inflation data** <br>
The [Consumer Price Index (CPI) data](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCNS) was used to adjust the movie revenue data for inflation. This ensures that all financial values are comparable to the most recent yearâ€™s dollars. The CPI data was pre-processed and used to adjust the revenue values in the dataset.

## Methods

### Data merging and pre-processing

Initially, all the different datasets are cleaned individually.
- CMU dataset: The numeric fields are converted to appropriate data types. Data fields are standardised to datetime format. The structure fields (languages, countries, genres) are parsed.
- IMDb dataset: Currently, no specific pre-processing is applied.
- TMDB dataset: The date components (year, month, day) are extracted. The financial fields are converted to numeric format. Zero values in the budget and revenue columns are replaced by NaN.

After this first pre-processing step, the three datasets are merged. This happens in two steps.
- Merge CMU with TMDB: A left join on the movie title and release year is applied. Missing data for the box office revenue in the CMU dataset is filled with data from the TMDB dataset if available. Redundant columns are removed after the merge.
- Merge with IMDb: The previously combined dataset is combined with IMDb information from multiple sources. Left joins are used to add title basics, ratings and crew details. The first director is extracted and used to get director details from IMDbâ€™s name basics dataset. Redundant columns are removed to finalise the dataset.

The next phase involves cleaning the merged dataset. Rows with missing values in the combined revenue column are removed. Missing values for the average rating and number of votes columns are replaced with 0 and missing values in the director column are replaced with 'unknown'.

Once the cleaning is completed, an inflation adjustment is made to the dataset. This step adjusts the movie revenue data for inflation to ensure that all financial values are comparable to the most recent yearâ€™s dollars. The [Consumer Price Index (CPI) data](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCNS) is loaded and pre-processed. Movies released before the earliest available CPI data are removed. The revenue values for the remaining movies are adjusted using the CPI data, aligning them with the target year (the most recent release year). This ensures that all financial values are in current-year dollars, accounting for inflation over time.

At the end of the data pre-processing, some final checks are performed. There should be no negative revenues and no future release dates. The essential columns (movie name, release year, combined revenue, inflated revenue, movie genres and average rating) should exist. The data should be complete, with no Null values. It is also verified that the revenue inflation correction has been applied correctly.

The data resulting from the pre-processing described above is saved as `movies_processed.csv` and used for the analysis.


### Implementation of the research questions

This part provides an overview of the different methods that are used or will be used to implement the analysis based on the different research questions. Some methods may be added in the future. Descriptions of the methods can also be found in the Jupyter notebook `results.ipynb`. 

**Movie 1:** General descriptive statistics are used to summarise the data. Histograms visualize the distribution of IMDb ratings. Bar plots display the number of movies per genre and scatter plots explore the relationship between IMDb ratings and box office revenue. In order to determine the correlation between the rating and the box office revenue, Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients are used and the correlation is visualised in a heatmap. Additionally, the linear regression outputs are analysed and the regression line is plotted. A joint plot combines several methods to visualise the relationship between the ratings and the box office revenue. 

**Movie 2:** For the initial exploration the unique country and language names were extracted and some exploratory prints were performed. Only the first country and language are taken since they are considered as the main ones. Including all the countries and languages would likely give them too much importance compared to the main ones. The most common countries and languages are plotted in a bar chart. To investigate the influence of the language, the languages with the highest average box office revenue are plotted in a bar chart. Regression analysis as well as ANOVA are performed. The same methods are used to analyse the influence of the country. A correlation analysis, along with regression and ANOVA, is used to determine the relationship between language and country. To estimate the influence of multilingual movies ANOVA is performed.

**Movie 3:** Some descriptive statistics, along with bar plots, are used to determine the average and median revenue per genre. To analyse the distribution of revenues within each genre, statistics such as the interquartile range, variance, and skewness are used. The visualisations are done with box plots and violin plots. A line plot is used to display the change in revenue per genre over time. Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients are also used.

**Movie 4:** Bar plots are used to display the directors with the highest box office revenues, as well as those with the most movies and the best average revenue per movie. Some statistical methods will also be used.

**Movie 5:** A bar plot is used to explore the revenues per season, whereas a scatter plot displays the movie runtimes versus the revenues per season. A heatmap, along with a facet grid, is used to analyse the revenue based on genre and season. A regression is performed to fit the runtime with the revenue per season. A pivot table shows genre popularity over time. ANOVA is performed to analyse the influence of the season. Box plots display the distribution of revenues per season and per genre.
